Interval/Segment Problems
- process by point

Sweep Line
- define line by rightmost included element on the left side

Order/Coordinate Compression
- order[1..N]
- order sort (a,b)->arr[a]-arr[b]

Query for ancestor-descendant relationship in a tree O(N+Q)
- using DFS store in time and pop time for each node
- ancestor_in < child_in && ancestor_out > child_out

LCA
- Method1: Binary Lifting
- Method2: Euler Tour

Online queries
- BIT
- Segment Tree
- Square Root Decomposition

Offline queries
- permute queries efficiently
- static preprocess
- Sparse Table

Geometry
- :( its just hard

Fractions/Decimals
- epsilon
- rounding
- fraction class

Dynamic Programming
* Standard
    - base case, transition, states
* Range
    - calc dp[start][len] (messy)
        - for (len), for (start)
    - calc dp[l][r]
        - for (r=N,r--) for (l=r,l++)

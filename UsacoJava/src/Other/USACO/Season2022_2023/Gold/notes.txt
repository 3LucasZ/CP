Absolute Round Failure...
105/1000

P1:
* Had a solution in mind to solve first 15/20 cases but only worked on 8
* Easily solved: Changed dp to push forward instead of retrieve backward and set init dp states to -INF
P2:
* 3 hours of implementation, logic was correct but implementation was not
* Easily solved: tree set hash collisions must be accounted for, and to change an element you must delete it, change it, then add it
P3:
* Looked at it for a few minutes and had a general idea (incrementally set the minDegree and try out CC). Not enough time to try out.
* Easily solved: Tried out the above quick algorithm and got 9/20 cases
* With a couple hours of work got a full solve (20/20) with optimization and reverse add DSU trick

Actual: 105/1000
Hypothetical: 750/1000
Goal: 500/1000
Infinite time: 1000/1000
Result: Failure but will lead to success.
